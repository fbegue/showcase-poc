//1st attempt

- "Description4" is often key tracks, but not always
- "Field" is the entire list item

//2nd attempt
- removed "Field" b/c was causing wonky JSON, didn't feel like fixing
- had to add single ']' to end of each json file to make legit
    - then fed into https://jsonformatter.org/json-pretty-print


//3rd attempt

CHATGPT ... kind of worked. it wouldn't fetch the key tracks actually LISTED on the page
