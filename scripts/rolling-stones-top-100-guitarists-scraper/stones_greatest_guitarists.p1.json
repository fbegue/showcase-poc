In the Doors, he had the improvisatory flair to follow Jim Morrison's wildest journeys, wrote some of their biggest hits (\"Light My Fire\"), and picked up the slack in their keyboard-drums-guitar lineup. \"Not having a bass player… made me play more bass notes to fill out the bottom,\" he said. \"Not having a rhythm player also made me play differently, to fill out the sound. I always felt like three players simultaneously.\"",

She was a folkie who had learned to play what they call an indicated arrangement, where you are like a band in the way you approach a chord and string the melody along. She was so new and fresh with how she approached it. It's the reason I fell in love with her music. She was a fantastic rhythm player and growing so fast. She had mastered the idea that she could tune the guitar any way she wanted, to get other inversions of the chords. I was doing that too, but she went further. I understood her joy in using bigger tools later – jazz bands, orchestra. But the stuff she did that was basically her, like 1971's Blue, was her strongest stuff. Match her and Bob Dylan up as poets, and they are in the same ballpark. But she was a much more sophisticated musician.  By David Crosby",

Songs like his 1969 cover of \"Highway 61 Revisited\" are astonishing showpieces of his lightningfast thumb-picked electric slide playing. Jimi Hendrix sought him out as a sideman, and Muddy Waters recognized his talent at first glance, becoming a friend and collaborator: \"That guy up there onstage – I got to see him up close,\" Waters later said. \"He plays eight notes to my one!\"",

Walsh brought a hard-rock edge to the Eagles' easygoing pop songs, creating a series of indestructible licks in the process: See his staccato-snarl riff in \"Life in the Fast Lane\" and his elegant aggression in the dueling-guitars section of \"Hotel California.\" Walsh influenced the Who's 1971 classic, Who's Next, although he didn't play a note on it: He gave Pete Townshend, as a gift, the 1959 Gretsch Chet Atkins guitar that Townshend played all over that album. Townshend later repaid the favor while talking to Rolling Stone in 1975: \"Joe Walsh is a fluid and intelligent player. There're not many like that around.\"",

King – as well as a knockout songwriter. Along with guitarists like Magic Sam and Buddy Guy, Rush helped create the more modernized, R&B-influenced approach to Chicago blues that came to be known as the West Side Sound. Rush's impact on later generations was enormous: His late-Fifties and early-Sixties singles were go-to covers for Led Zeppelin (\"I Can't Quit You Baby\"), John Mayall (\"All Your Love [I Miss Loving]\") and the J.

Later, he set the stage for country rock and transferred that dynamic precision and melodic symmetry to the electric guitar. A top session man in the Sixties, he played on the Byrds' 1968 landmark, Sweetheart of the Rodeo. After he joined the band later that year, White brought a full-bodied rock elation to his California-inflected Nashville chops. \"He never played anything that sounded vaguely weak,\" said the Byrds' leader, Roger McGuinn. \"He was always driving… into the music.\" White had returned to bluegrass with the acclaimed Muleskinner album when he was killed by a drunk driver in 1973. He was 29. \"Clarence was immersed in hard country and bluegrass,\" said Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys. \"He incorporated those elements into rock & roll, and it totally blew people's minds.\"",

His voluptuous arpeggios – often played on a chiming Rickenbacker with incredible flow and detailing – were every bit as essential to the Smiths' signature sound as Morrissey's baritone.
