They stay a certain way. Jerry Garcia was painting outside the frame. He played blues but mixed it with bluegrass and Ravi Shankar. He had country and Spanish in there. There was a lot of Chet Atkins in him – going up and down the frets. But you could always hear a theme in his playing. It's like putting beads on a string, instead of throwing them around a room. Jerry had a tremendous sense of purpose. When you take a solo, decide what to say, get there and give it to the next guy. That's how Jerry worked in the Dead.

Think of the introduction to Sam and Dave's \"Soul Man,\" the explosive bent notes in Booker T.'s \"Green Onions\" or the filigreed guitar fills in Redding's \"(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay\" – they all bear Cropper's signature sound, the quintessence of soul guitar. \"I don't care about being center stage,\" says Cropper. \"I'm a band member, always been a band member.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Key Tracks:</strong> \"(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay,\" \"Green Onions,\" \"Soul Man\"</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://open.spotify.com/user/rsedit/playlist/448wUaELWsusdJAQbNBKW7\"><img src=\"//img.wennermedia.com/rs-assets%2Fimages%2Fembedded%2F9b71720c806aee852c8d3b54c077b5eda7f8f94f.png\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Related</strong><br>• <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/otis-redding-sittin-on-the-dock-of-the-bay-19691231\">The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time: Otis Reddings' '(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay'</a><br>• <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/sam-and-dave-soul-man-19691231\">The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time: Sam and Dave's 'Soul Man'</a></p>\n</div></article><div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__advert\">\t<div class=\"admz\" id=\"adm-in-list-x-11\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"adma boomerang\" data-device=\"Desktop\" data-width=\"728\">\n\t\t\t\t\n<div style=\"min-width:50px;min-height:75px;\" class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\" data-priority=\"8\">\n\t<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyX-uid11\" class=\"adw-728 adh-90\" data-is-adhesion-ad=\"\">\n\t\t<script type=\"application/javascript\">\n\t\t\tblogherads.adq.push(function () {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tblogherads\n\t\t\t\t\t.defineSlot( 'banner', 'gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyX-uid11' )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid\",\"in-listX\",\"btf\",\"inbodyX\"] )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setSubAdUnitPath(\"music\\/list\\/inbodyX\")\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.addSize([[728,90],[3,3]])\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setLazyLoadMultiplier(2)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t</script>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n</div>"},{"Title":"The Edge","Image":"","cgalleryverticalslide__photocredit":"PAUL BERGEN/REDFERNS","Number":"38","Description":"A lot had  already been said about the guitar by the time the Edge picked it up.

As a guitarist, he drew from all of those sources, then improvised with a furious and genuine delight.

He goes, \"I came up with that.\" And I said, \"Really? How?\" He said, \"I was just standing there and thought, 'I've got to do something!' \" That pretty much sums him up. He just had a way of getting right to the business, of finding the right thing to play. That was part of that Beatles magic – they all seemed to find the right thing to play.</p>\n<p>George knew every obscure <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/artist/elvis-presley\">Elvis</a> solo; his initial influences were rockabilly – <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/artist/carl-perkins\">Carl Perkins</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/artist/eddie-cochran\">Eddie Cochran</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/artist/chet-atkins\">Chet Atkins</a>, Scotty Moore – but he always added something to it.

That was a whole new sound too – Roger McGuinn got the idea from George, and then Roger took it to his own place with the Byrds.</p>\n<p>When he moved over to the slide guitar later in the Beatles' career, it was a really beautiful thing to hear him play that. He once said to me, \"I think modern guitar players are forgetting about pitch,\" and that was something he really cared about. He was very in tune when he played, the slide was very precise, and just a beautiful vibrato on it. It really sounded like a voice, like a very distinct, signature voice that came out of him. Just listen to those records. They're so immaculate, so inventive. He was a guy who could just add so much. &nbsp;<em>By Tom Petty</em></p>\n<p><strong>Key Tracks:</strong> \"I Saw Her Standing There,\" \"Something\"</p>\n<p><strong>Related</strong><br>• <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/music/photos/the-private-life-of-george-harrison-20110902\">Photos: The Private Life of George Harrison</a><br>• <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/music/music-news/george-harrison-gets-back-245170/\">George Harrison Gets Back: Rolling Stone's 1987 Cover Story<br></a>• <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/music/music-news/george-harrison-1943-2001-248530/\">George Harrison: 1943-2001</a></p>\n</div></article><div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__advert\">\t<div class=\"admz\" id=\"adm-in-list-x-39\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"adma boomerang\" data-device=\"Desktop\" data-width=\"728\">\n\t\t\t\t\n<div style=\"min-width:50px;min-height:75px;\" class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\" data-priority=\"8\">\n\t<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyX-uid39\" class=\"adw-728 adh-90\" data-is-adhesion-ad=\"\">\n\t\t<script type=\"application/javascript\">\n\t\t\tblogherads.adq.push(function () {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tblogherads\n\t\t\t\t\t.defineSlot( 'banner', 'gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyX-uid39' )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid\",\"in-listX\",\"btf\",\"inbodyX\"] )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setSubAdUnitPath(\"music\\/list\\/inbodyX\")\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.addSize([[728,90],[3,3]])\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setLazyLoadMultiplier(2)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t</script>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n</div>"},{"Title":"Pete Townshend","Image":"","cgalleryverticalslide__photocredit":"JAN PERSSON/REDFERNS","Number":"10","Description":"Pete Townshend doesn't play many solos, which might be why so many people don’t realize just how good he really is.

And you can’t ignore me.” Even in the Yardbirds, he had a tone that was melodic but in-your-face – bright, urgent and edgy, but sweet at the same time.

He was not holding back.","Description_URL":"https://www.rollingstone.com/artist/jeff-beck","Description1":"Jeff Beck","Description_URL2":"https://www.rollingstone.com/artist/the-yardbirds","Description3":"Yardbirds","Description4":"There is a real artistry to playing with and around a vocalist, answering and pushing him. That’s the beauty of those two records he made with Rod Stewart, 1968’s Truth and 1969’s Beck-Ola. Jeff is not getting in the way, but he’s holding his own. And he stretched the boundaries of the blues. “Beck’s Bolero,” on Truth, is un-bluesy, but still blues-based.

It’s like he’s saying, “I’m Jeff Beck. I’m right here. And you can’t ignore me.” Even in the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/artist/the-yardbirds\">Yardbirds</a>, he had a tone that was melodic but in-your-face – bright, urgent and edgy, but sweet at the same time. You could tell he was a serious player, and he was going for it. He was not holding back.</p>\n<p>There is a real artistry to playing with and around a vocalist, answering and pushing him. That’s the beauty of those two records he made with <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/artist/rod-stewart\">Rod Stewart</a>, 1968’s <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/music/music-album-reviews/truth-2-184508/\"><em>Truth</em></a> and 1969’s <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/music/music-album-reviews/beck-ola-190075/\"><em>Beck-Ola</em></a>. Jeff is not getting in the way, but he’s holding his own. And he stretched the boundaries of the blues. “Beck’s Bolero,” on Truth, is un-bluesy, but still blues-based. One of my favorite tracks is the cover of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/artist/howlin-wolf\">Howlin’ Wolf</a>‘s “I Ain’t Superstitious,” on <em>Truth</em>. There is a sense of humor – that wah-wah growl. I don’t know if Clapton plays with the same sense of humor, as great as he is. Jeff’s definitely got that.</p>\n<p>When he got into his fusion phase, the cover of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/artist/stevie-wonder\">Stevie Wonder</a>‘s “‘Cause We’ve Ended as Lovers,” on <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/music/music-album-reviews/blow-by-blow-247132/\"><em>Blow by Blow</em></a>, got me immediately. The tone was so pure and delicate. It’s like there was a vocalist singing, but there was a guitarist making all of the notes. I saw him last year at a casino in San Diego, and the guitar was the voice. You didn’t miss the singer, because the guitar was so lyrical. There is a spirituality and confidence in him, a commitment to being great. After I saw that show, I went home and started practicing. Maybe that’s what I took from him: If you want to be Jeff Beck, do your homework. &nbsp;<em>By Mike Campbell of the Heartbreakers</em></p>\n<p><strong>Key Tracks:</strong> “Beck’s Bolero,” “Freeway Jam,” “A Day in the Life,” “I Ain’t Superstitious,” “Heart Full of Soul”</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://open.spotify.com/user/rsedit/playlist/448wUaELWsusdJAQbNBKW7\"><img src=\"//img.wennermedia.com/rs-assets%2Fimages%2Fembedded%2F9b71720c806aee852c8d3b54c077b5eda7f8f94f.png\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Related</strong><br>• <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/music/music-news/jeff-beck-on-his-legendary-unreleased-1970-motown-album-111450/\">Jeff Beck on his Legendary Unreleased 1970 Motown Album</a><br>• <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/music/blogs/alternate-take/jeff-becks-essential-bootlegs-20100629\">Jeff Beck’s Essential Bootlegs</a><br>• <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/music/music-news/jeff-beck-opens-up-about-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-gigs-with-clapton-jeff-beck-group-reunion-246661/\">Jeff Beck Opens Up About Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Gigs with Clapton, Jeff Beck Group Reunion</a></p>\n</div></article><div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__advert\">\t<div class=\"admz\" id=\"adm-in-list-x-45\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"adma boomerang\" data-device=\"Desktop\" data-width=\"728\">\n\t\t\t\t\n<div style=\"min-width:50px;min-height:75px;\" class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\" data-priority=\"8\">\n\t<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyX-uid45\" class=\"adw-728 adh-90\" data-is-adhesion-ad=\"\">\n\t\t<script type=\"application/javascript\">\n\t\t\tblogherads.adq.push(function () {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tblogherads\n\t\t\t\t\t.defineSlot( 'banner', 'gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyX-uid45' )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setTargeting( 'pos', [\"mid\",\"in-listX\",\"btf\",\"inbodyX\"] )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setSubAdUnitPath(\"music\\/list\\/inbodyX\")\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.addSize([[728,90],[3,3]])\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t.setLazyLoadMultiplier(2)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t</script>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n</div>"},{"Title":"Keith Richards","Image":"","cgalleryverticalslide__photocredit":"CHRISTOPHER SIMON SYKES/HULTON ARCHIVE/GETTY IMAGES","Number":"4","Description":"I remember being  in junior high school, hearing \"Satisfaction\" and being freaked out by what it did to me.

There was a basic simplicity to his playing, his style, his vibe and his sound. He took a Gibson guitar and plugged it into a Marshall, and that was it. The basics. The blues. His solos were melodic and memorable – and that’s what guitar solos should be, part of the song. I could hum them to you.</p>\n<p>What I really liked was Cream’s live recordings, because you could hear the three guys playing. If you listen to “I’m So Glad,” on <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/music/music-album-reviews/goodbye-250735/\"><em>Goodbye</em></a>, you really hear the three guys go – and Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker were a couple of jazz guys, pushing Clapton forward. I once read that Clapton said, “I didn’t know what the hell I was doing.” He was just trying to keep up with the other two guys!</p>\n<p>After Cream, he changed. When he started doing “I Shot the Sheriff” and this and that, and when he hooked up with Delaney and Bonnie, his whole style changed. Or at least his sound. He focused more on singing than playing. I respect him for everything he’s done and is still doing – but what inspired me, what made me pick up a guitar, was his early stuff. I could play some of those solos now – they’re permanently imprinted in my brain. That blues-based sound is still the core of modern rock guitar. &nbsp;<em>By Eddie Van Halen</em></p>\n<p><strong>Key Tracks:</strong> “Bell Bottom Blues,” “Crossroads,” “White Room”</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://open.spotify.com/user/rsedit/playlist/448wUaELWsusdJAQbNBKW7\"><img src=\"//img.wennermedia.com/rs-assets%2Fimages%2Fembedded%2F9b71720c806aee852c8d3b54c077b5eda7f8f94f.png\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Related</strong><br>• <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/eric-clapton-19691231\">The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time: Eric Clapton</a><br>• <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/music/photos/crossroads-2010-20100628\">Photos: Crossroads 2010</a><br>• <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/music/music-news/eric-clapton-on-revisiting-layla-sobriety-and-reflecting-on-his-life-71797/\">Eric Clapton on Revisiting ‘Layla,’ Sobriety and Reflecting on his Life</a></p>\n</div></article><div class=\"c-gallery-vertical__advert\">\t<div class=\"admz\" id=\"adm-in-list-x-48\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"adma boomerang\" data-device=\"Desktop\" data-width=\"728\">\n\t\t\t\t\n<div style=\"min-width:50px;min-height:75px;\" class=\"pmc-adm-boomerang-pub-div ad-text\" data-priority=\"8\">\n\t<div id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-list-inbodyX-uid48\" class=\"adw-728 adh-90\" data-is-adhesion-ad=\"\" style=\"align-items: center; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; min-width: 728px; min-height: 90px; display: flex;\" data-google-query-id=\"CL2D-8HEovwCFQWiAQodu88NjA\">\n\t\t\n\t<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/Rollingstone/music/list/inbodyX_13__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/Rollingstone/music/list/inbodyX_13\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/Rollingstone/music/list/inbodyX_13\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" tabindex=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-pointer-lock allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\" data-load-complete=\"true\" data-google-container-id=\"i\" data-integralas-id-28f470c3-dd08-569a-8391-b43d27f0c6a6=\"\" data-integralas-id-11676986-59f8-55cc-1707-4c2d4a6d67df=\"\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n</div>"},{"Title":"Jimi Hendrix","Image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-136467-2b1d08ea01d2714a82785574e1434b4dcbecbc53.jpg?w=306","cgalleryverticalslide__photocredit":"DAVID REDFERN/REDFERNS","Number":"1","Description":"Jimi Hendrix exploded our idea of what rock music could be: He manipulated the guitar, the whammy bar, the studio and the stage.
