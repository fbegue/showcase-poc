## notes

- Can't seem to sign-in on app startup nor hit the 'Save' or 'Run' buttons if I'm on TorGuard VPN, which is strange
    - possible configuration fix available for proxies specifically?
        - https://helpcenter.octoparse.com/en/articles/6470932-set-up-ip-proxies
- I thought I had ran into security issues by hitting songkick with octoparse in the past but not sure how long / how many runs are required to trigger stoppage
